# RNNs 
In this repsitery, I am gonna share with you some of the problems, which faced and my proposed solutions. 
It would be my pleasure if you share your experinces about these problems and your ideas about my solutions.
# First problem: bias impact on LSTM and GRU performance
Based on [An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures.pdf](https://github.com/mohammadmehdikeramati/Text-Classification/files/9563647/An.Empirical.Exploration.of.Recurrent.Network.Architectures.pdf) paper, Icame up with the amazing impact of adding bias in improving convergence of LSTM and GRU.
